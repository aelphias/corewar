**COREWAR -> VM**

We have:
	- REG_NUMBER registers
	- PC - a register that has address of next set of instructions to execute
	- a flag carry
champions positioned evenly on arena
Processes executed sequantially.
VM must check processes after every CYCLE_TO_DIE periods 
---> to answer the question if process executed "live" at least 1 time.
if at least 1 NBR_LIVE execution of live has been since last check
	---> decrease CYCLE_TO_DIE of CYCLE_DELTA units
GAME OVER when all processes are dead
WINNER -->  who last reported alive

Given asm can show code with annotation: ./asm -a file.s
Good champions:
./corewar -n Octobre_Rouge_V4.2.cor Gagnant.cor  
--
	if live executed --> decrease CYCLE_TO_DIE units
--
memory is circular
--
Чтобы player жил --> execute live with plr_id
--
live: The instruction that allows a process to stay alive. 
It can also record that the player whose number is the argument
 is indeed alive. No argument’s coding byte, opcode 0x01.
 Oh and its only argument is on 4 bytes.
